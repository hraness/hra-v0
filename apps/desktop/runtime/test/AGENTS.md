# Contents

- Deterministic multi-account app-server behavior, pre-turn account routing, quota terminalization, cloud-dispatch transport, local dispatch durability, promotion faults, protocol fixtures, gateway integration, generation recovery, local-data removal laws, and native feasibility probes.
- `fixtures/gateway-runtime/` – fail-closed executable placement fixtures that keep source gateway integration independent of the Zig build order.
- `fixtures/effective-user-home-preload.ts` – process-test-only effective-home override that preserves canonical path semantics.
- `fixtures/in-memory-secrets-preload.ts` – process-test-only secret custody with exact seeded values, deletion-failure injection, and value-free traces.
- `probes/` – standalone JSONL and app-server probes used by the pinned-runtime test boundary.
- `image-normalizer.macos.test.ts` – explicit macOS helper coverage for allowlisted image containers, animation and polyglot rejection, raster bounds, deterministic outputs, filesystem authority, cleanup, and entitlement-free signing.
- `installation-handoff-v3.test.ts`, `installation-handoff-v3-driver.test.ts`, and `installation-handoff-cli.test.ts` – schema-v3 progress durability, crash-cut transaction recovery, read-only status, exact command routing, schema-v2 isolation, and ordinary CLI output.
- `chat-attachment-vault.test.ts`, `chat-attachment-vault-migration.test.ts`, and `chat-attachment-vault.property.test.ts` – upload/finalize idempotency, exact chunking, filesystem and digest custody, physical quotas, provider leases, crash/reopen reconciliation, archive/privacy journals, and bounded parser laws.
- `shipped-javascript-licenses.test.ts` – production-closure, nested-document, hash, sentinel, missing-text, and byte-semantics regressions for packaged notices.

# Guidelines

- Keep fake-server scenarios deterministic and runnable without network access or user credentials.
- Give source gateway integration its executable companion fixtures through the installed-runtime path seam. Do not make ordinary TypeScript tests depend on a prior native build.
- Cover arbitrary JSONL chunking, delayed output, server requests, malformed messages, unexpected exit, and restart reconciliation.
- Prove account isolation with distinct homes and generations, sparse usage updates, bounded projections, login recovery, retained-data tombstones, and transport-sized invalidation recovery.
- Verify launch, resume, later-turn bounded history injection, and streaming projections at the exact app-server seam. Prove a usage-limit terminal never causes history capture, injection, replacement selection, or replay.
- Exercise runner replay, lease and fence rejection, stop ambiguity, durable outbox replay, worktree containment, capacity, and completion without a live deployment.
- Prove the renderer parser rejects path-bearing project registration, provider thread and turn commands, queueing, steering, and interaction settlement.
- Property-test revision admission, cross-pane commutativity, Unicode bounds, model validation, quota proof, one-route terminalization, provider-free legacy recovery at every actor-start/attempt/turn crash cut, fail-closed recovery, and prompt absence from durable envelopes.
- Keep real Codex and macOS probes explicit. Portable checks must run without native toolchains or signed-in accounts.
- Keep the image-normalizer suite behind `test:macos`; use self-contained byte fixtures, exact path-free receipts, and private temporary directories. Prove both successful formats and fail-closed filesystem/container cases without relying on network access or ambient image tools.
- Keep license fixtures inside the ignored desktop output root. Prove missing metadata or text, special files, BOMs, nested notices, and hash drift fail closed without network access.
- Promote every shrunk property-test failure into a named regression.
