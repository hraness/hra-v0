# HRA v0 web control plane

This archived workspace owns HRA v0's Convex task backend and human control
plane. `taskctl` consumes its versioned HTTP API from the sibling CLI
workspace. The canonical HRA v0 origin is `https://hra-weld.vercel.app`. The
current HRA lives at `https://hra.sh` in `https://github.com/hraness/hra`.

The task workspace also owns desktop-runner presence and dispatch. A task created from the web surface is committed atomically with its queued run only when a non-expired HRA gateway advertises the selected repository and free capacity. The browser subscribes to server-authenticated readiness and a bounded public display stream: reasoning summaries, assistant messages, content-free tool activity, and lifecycle state. It never connects directly to a desktop app and never receives raw reasoning, tool details, local paths, command output, or Codex credentials.

The same Convex deployment exposes a separate optional session-sync relay for
the desktop. It stores signed membership evidence, wrapped keys, opaque
routing coordinates, bounded encrypted `session_summary` records, replay
defenses, and paged cursors. It never receives a vault root, private key,
prompt, response, transcript, reasoning, tool data, account identity,
provider identifier, or filesystem path. Remote summaries are view-only and a
relay outage cannot block local desktop chat.

The control plane uses the shared System-first design system. A first visit follows the operating-system appearance, while explicit Light, Dark, and System choices persist under the shared browser preference. The authenticated UI keeps its navigation rail and bars mounted while the selected workspace and `Tasks`/`Access` stage changes. Those selections are addressable with the `workspace` and `surface` query parameters; they do not change WorkOS organization authority or Convex task ownership. On compact viewports the same rail becomes a focus-trapped left drawer.

## Local development

Use Bun 1.3.14 and Node 24. From this directory:

```sh
CONVEX_AGENT_MODE=anonymous bun x convex init
bun run convex:dev
```

In a second terminal, run `bun run dev:web`. The first command creates ignored `.convex/` state and `.env.local`; commit neither. Set the credential pepper through `convex env set` before exercising enrollment or agent authentication. Set the hosted mutation fingerprint key before exercising browser writes.

From the repository root, `bun run web:hra` runs this workspace's combined
Convex and Next.js development command. It serves the hosted control plane with
browser hot reloading and does not start the Zig host or private desktop
gateway. A browser cannot itself spawn Codex or receive arbitrary filesystem
authority; it can only delegate work to a separately running, authenticated
local helper. Use `bun hra` for the product-development loop with the real
Native bridge, Codex/filesystem authority, and Vite hot reloading.

The four `HRA_HOSTED_MUTATION_FINGERPRINT_KEY_*` variables belong only in the Convex deployment. The current key is required for hosted browser mutations and must be a canonical unpadded base64url encoding of exactly 32 random bytes; its version is a portable identifier of at most 64 characters. Existing deployments may keep the corresponding `OPRTE_*` names with their exact values. HRA names take over only when absent or byte-for-byte equal to the old names; a disagreement fails closed. The rename does not rotate keys or change the persisted HMAC namespaces. Convex HMACs the browser's semantic digest with the organization, workspace, principal, source, and key version before the generic mutation journal sees it. The browser digest, raw intent, title, comment, answer, transcript, and provider data are never stored or returned by the backend.

Rotation is two-phase. Install a new current key and version while moving the former pair to `PREVIOUS`, then retain both until every open attempt bearing the previous version has settled. Only one previous version is accepted. Missing, malformed, duplicated, or half-configured key pairs fail closed. Removing the previous pair while one of its attempts remains open also makes new fingerprint resolution fail closed, preventing a replay under the new key.

After the backend, WorkOS fixture, and web app are running, enroll the desktop with a dispatcher-scoped taskctl agent and map a returned `repo_...` identifier to a local repository as described in [`../desktop/README.md`](../desktop/README.md). The runner uses the same local HTTP origin during development. The web readiness strip remains offline or blocked until the gateway's first accepted heartbeat; this is expected and does not prevent read-only task supervision.

WorkOS is optional for the provider-neutral agent-domain tests. Human HTTP routes always require a signed WorkOS access token. Configure `WORKOS_API_KEY`, `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`, `WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI` in the Next.js environment, and configure the matching API key and client ID in the Convex deployment environment. Convex derives the two supported production issuers from that client ID: `https://api.workos.com/` and `https://api.workos.com/user_management/<client-id>`. An environment-provided issuer override is not accepted. AuthKit exposes `/auth/sign-in`, `/auth/sign-up`, and `/auth/callback`; the browser access token is forwarded to Convex through `ConvexProviderWithAuth` and is not persisted by the app.

The signed local acceptance harness may replace WorkOS with an exact-loopback server. Before pushing Convex functions, set `TASKCTL_LOCAL_FIXTURES_ENABLED=true`, `TASKCTL_LOCAL_FIXTURE_ISSUER`, and `TASKCTL_LOCAL_FIXTURE_JWKS_URL` in the deployment environment so `auth.config.ts` can register its RS256 provider. The issuer and JWKS URL must both be loopback URLs. Set `WORKOS_API_HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1`, `WORKOS_API_HTTPS=false`, and `WORKOS_API_PORT` to route the WorkOS SDK to the same fake server. This changes the provider endpoint only: `/v1/organizations`, `/v1/workspaces`, and `/v1/agents` still reject missing, unsigned, wrong-issuer, and incorrectly organization-bound JWTs.

`POST /v1/auth/refresh` accepts the refresh token only in `Authorization: Bearer ...`, optionally selects a WorkOS organization from its JSON body, rotates the returned refresh token, and deliberately disables SDK retries so an ambiguous refresh cannot consume a token twice.

Organization provisioning leases the owner-membership step and durably marks the one allowed membership create before sending its zero-retry WorkOS request. Once marked, every retry is poll-only, including after an indeterminate response or an eventually consistent empty list. This prevents duplicate memberships; the deliberate tradeoff is that a crash after the marker commits but before the request is sent requires operator recovery instead of an automatic second create.

Configure `WORKOS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the Convex deployment and send WorkOS webhooks to `POST /webhooks/workos`. The route verifies the signature over the exact raw body before WorkOS parses JSON. It projects `organization.created`, `organization.updated`, `organization.deleted`, `organization_membership.created`, `organization_membership.updated`, and `organization_membership.deleted`; other valid signed events receive an idempotent ignored receipt. Receipts use the WorkOS event ID and remain for 30 days.

Two leased, paginated Convex jobs run every 15 minutes. One rechecks projected membership IDs, including provider-side deletion; the other enumerates active, inactive, and pending provider memberships for every projected WorkOS organization so a missed create webhook is recoverable. Bounded runs schedule immediate cursor-based continuations instead of waiting for the next interval. Provider calls remain in actions, and projection writes remain in transactions.

The workspace serves the canonical `hra-weld.vercel.app` origin. Local `bun run build`
compiles the application without provider mutation. Vercel uses the separate
checked build entry in `vercel.json`: only its exact Production target may
deploy Convex functions to `benevolent-akita-439`. A generated Preview skips
Convex deployment and builds an anonymous app-only client of the exact
`benevolent-akita-439.convex.cloud` and `benevolent-akita-439.convex.site`
public endpoints. Custom staging and every unrecognized provider target fail
closed. The Next.js configuration binds every verified Vercel deployment to
the registered `hra` project and exact Git object through
`X-Hraness-Delivery-Proof`. It preserves HRA's security and private-cache
headers, and adds `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow, noarchive` to generated
Preview responses. Session sync remains fail-closed while
`HRA_SESSION_SYNC_ENABLED` is absent or `false`; the unchanged
`OPRTE_SESSION_SYNC_ENABLED` value remains a fallback, and conflicting names
fail closed. Enable it only after the
exact WorkOS application, Convex environment, desktop public coordinates, and
production HTTP route readbacks pass for the same source revision.

## Production provider cutover

Before any provider deployment, enable Vercel's **Automatically expose System
Environment Variables** setting on the exact HRA project and read it back as
enabled for Production and Preview. The source gate requires Vercel's own
`VERCEL`, target, Git provider, repository owner/name, branch, and full commit
SHA evidence. It intentionally refuses when that project setting is disabled
or any system identity is absent; caller-created substitutes are not an
accepted deployment path.

Scope the public `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL` records to Vercel Production and Preview, with
the exact `benevolent-akita-439` URLs. Scope the Convex production deploy-key record,
`SUITE_IDENTITY_RECEIPT_KEY_VERSION`, `SUITE_OIDC_COOKIE_SECRET`, and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to Production only. Scope `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` to
Production only as well; it is a public project token, but it grants analytics
ingestion capability. Use the token for shared PostHog project `543691`, and
enable cookieless mode in that project. When present, the browser sends one anonymous,
cookieless `$pageview` for exact canonical public routes to the fixed
`https://us.i.posthog.com` host. It sends no analytics from Preview, `/app`,
authentication, callbacks, APIs, account or task surfaces, or route near
misses. A missing token leaves analytics inert; a configured malformed token
refuses the Production build before Next.js can embed it. The deploy key must name
`benevolent-akita-439`, the selector must be `v1`, and the site URL must be
`https://hra-weld.vercel.app`. Create a fresh HRA-held deploy key for that deployment and a
fresh independent HRA cookie secret. Do not copy or share the predecessor
deploy key or cookie secret. Cookies cannot cross from `oprte.com` to `hra-weld.vercel.app`,
and deploy keys are exact project/environment custody. Do not copy the
predecessor `https://oprte.com` site value.

Create the deploy key only with the source-owned Management API helper. The
helper requires the immutable Convex project ID `2680173`, Production
deployment ID `4677913`, deployment name `benevolent-akita-439`, and pre-rename
`cclrte:oprte` identity. It requests exactly `deployment:deploy`, verifies the
new key metadata, and writes the returned secret only through an already-open
caller-owned mode-0600 file descriptor. Its report contains IDs, names,
permissions, file mode, and byte count, never the personal access token, deploy
key, or a stable secret digest.

First restrict every retained copy of the Convex personal-token config,
including dated backups, to its owner. Then create a fresh empty destination
in a fresh owner-only directory and pass only canonical paths:

```sh
find ~/.convex -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'config.json*' -exec chmod 0600 {} \;
CONVEX_AUTH_FILE="$(realpath ~/.convex/config.json)"
HRA_PROVIDER_DIR="$(mktemp -d /private/tmp/hra-provider-cutover.XXXXXX)"
chmod 0700 "$HRA_PROVIDER_DIR"
HRA_DEPLOY_KEY_FILE="$(mktemp "$HRA_PROVIDER_DIR/deploy-key.XXXXXX")"
chmod 0600 "$HRA_DEPLOY_KEY_FILE"
bun run provider:create-convex-deploy-key -- \
  --auth-file "$CONVEX_AUTH_FILE" \
  --secret-file "$HRA_DEPLOY_KEY_FILE"
```

Do not use `convex deployment token create` for this key. Convex 1.44 does not
send an `allowedActions` constraint from that command, and its default path
prints the generated secret. If the checked helper reports any failure, or
exits abnormally after sending the create request, do not rerun it until you
inspect the fixed
`vercel-hra-production-2026-08-17` name in the dashboard, revoke any incomplete
result, empty the destination, and begin again. This recovery rule includes
post-create readback, file write, `fsync`, path-identity, and abnormal-exit
failures because the provider key may exist even when local custody did not
commit. Install the successful file as the HRA Vercel Production deploy-key
record without copying it through argv, shell history, or terminal output.
Remove the local file only after Vercel scope and build readback succeed.

Do not configure Convex-only custody in Vercel, even as an empty record. The
Production wrapper refuses the receipt keyring, session flags, hosted-mutation
keys, taskctl peppers or fixture settings, WorkOS webhook secret and owner
role, and local WorkOS provider overrides. Configure those values only on the
exact Convex deployment.

HRA v0 publication now has two non-secret provenance anchors. Keep
`HRA_RELEASE_PUBLICATION_COMMIT_ALLOWLIST` fixed at publication commit
`6221f79b745f154882080936b961ff431569f33e`. Set
`HRA_V0_SURFACE_COMMIT_ALLOWLIST` to the reviewed archive-surface commit or a
comma-separated list of at most 32 reviewed full commit IDs. The provider
wrapper binds Vercel's canonical `hraness/hra-v0` source SHA to the surface
allowlist, proves that surface descends from the immutable publication, and
proves `release-download.json` stayed byte-identical. It separately replays the
exact candidate-to-publication transition and annotated tag from the maintained
repository. Both variables are removed before the final Next build. A missing
anchor, wrong repository, unallowlisted surface, rewritten release contract, or
Production branch other than `main` makes the build refuse.

Transfer no custom-staging record. Preview refuses the deploy key, deployment
token, Convex selector, canonical production site claim, Suite cookie or key
selector, WorkOS credentials, and every other checked production capability,
including an empty provider record. Its two public Convex URLs grant no
backend publication authority.

The create-only deploy-key and shared-authority procedures above are initialization
and recovery guidance. They are not v0.1.14 publication steps while the verified
v0.1.13 authorities remain live. Do not create or rotate the HRA deploy key,
cookie or identity-link secret, Accounts entry, HRA keyring, or receipt-key
selector for this recovery release.

Use this order for the v0.1.14 recovery publication:

1. Read back that the predecessor Vercel project remains publication-frozen,
   has no deployment in flight, and retains its unchanged READY rollback
   anchor. Preserve its bounded rollback key without rotating or recreating it.
2. Read back the existing HRA Vercel project and Git link, exact build commands,
   environment-name inventory, and environment scoping. Preserve every existing
   deploy, cookie, Suite identity, WorkOS, and Convex selector authority without
   exposing or rewriting its value. Preview must remain free of production-only
   authority.
3. Read back the existing Accounts HRA entry, HRA-only identity-link keyring,
   and receipt-key selector with the checked audits. Treat any drift as a stop;
   do not repair it by generating or appending a replacement during release.
4. From the exact candidate commit C, complete the full package, then follow
   the desktop release runbook to create and push the
   direct annotated `v0.1.14` tag and
   publish the exact seven-asset immutable GitHub prerelease. Fill the
   working-tree publication contract from C's emitted evidence and require
   `bun run verify:remote-release` to read back exact remote names, byte counts,
   SHA-256 digests, checksum, manifest, DMG binding, and corresponding-source
   binding before committing P. Create P as the exact contract-only child,
   push it, and require the green Required CI source-and-remote readback for
   that exact P. Preserve the v0.1.13 publication allowlist throughout C. A Git
   build of candidate C may proceed against the unchanged backend authority;
   it must not create or rotate provider authority. The automatic build of
   published P must then refuse against the retained v0.1.13 allowlist.
5. Only after Required succeeds for exact P, replace
   `HRA_RELEASE_PUBLICATION_COMMIT_ALLOWLIST` with P in Production and Preview.
   This allowlist update is the only environment write for v0.1.14. Redeploy
   exact P, then read back its canonical Git SHA, complete build commands,
   unchanged environment inventory and scoping, READY state, production routes,
   release delivery, discovery, and OIDC endpoints before enabling or exercising
   the installation handoff.
6. Preserve all predecessor and HRA backend authorities through installed-app
   acceptance and the bounded rollback window. Their later disposition is a
   separate handoff decision, not part of v0.1.14 publication.

The existing annotated `v0.1.11` tag object
`e4c171e33e414d74a36791fc8577cbfbcef8e52e` points directly to
`5a2a9842cacc75fee42ab8e23ca8c215a643e21e`, but has no GitHub release or
assets. Treat it as retired tag-only evidence, never as publication or
installation authority.

The immutable v0.1.13 build 14 prerelease remains the current published
predecessor and valid prior installed-app authority while v0.1.14 is a
candidate. Its direct annotated tag object
`44f00fd5c5e00bc8dcded0c9b176a8e37ada90f3` points to
`9ba06a441c9b12b448cfe34784432592dbeccb19`, and publication commit
`7825cb231890aa971f965412c31dfa2cb7796561` records the release evidence. Its
source handoff operator fails before installation because its hidden candidate
stage does not retain the required `.app` suffix. Do not retire, replace,
relabel, or use that source operator for cutover.

### Convex project identity retirement

Rename the Convex project only after candidate C, publication P, the HRA-only
Suite keyring readbacks, production route checks, and installed-app acceptance
have all passed. Keeping the project named OPRTE during those gates avoids
labeling the still-running predecessor functions and environment as HRA before
the actual authority cutover. The fresh HRA deploy key and retained predecessor
key both use the `prod:benevolent-akita-439|...` deployment identity, so the
later project-slug change does not alter either key's target or provide a reason
to shorten the rollback window.

Bind every mutation to immutable IDs in its before-and-after evidence, and use
an ID-addressed endpoint wherever the Management API provides one. Deployment
and deploy-key retirement endpoints are name-addressed, so resolve each name to
the exact ID below immediately before mutation and require that exact ID to be
absent afterward:

- Project `2680173` belongs to team `513923` / `cclrte`, initially has name and
  slug `oprte`, and names `benevolent-akita-439` as its default Production
  deployment.
- Production deployment `4677913` remains project `2680173`, cloud type
  `prod`, default `true`, reference `production`, region `aws-us-east-1`, and
  URL `https://benevolent-akita-439.convex.cloud`.
- Environment-variable **names only** and every deploy-key ID, name,
  permission set, expiry, and last-used timestamp remain byte-for-byte equal.
  Never print or export environment values or deploy-key values for this
  comparison.

Use `GET /v1/projects/2680173`,
`GET /v1/deployments/benevolent-akita-439`, and
`GET /v1/deployments/benevolent-akita-439/list_deploy_keys` for those filtered
Management API records. Capture the environment-name set without values:

These HTTP literals are evidence contracts, not `curl` instructions. Perform
the readbacks and later mutations in the signed-in Convex dashboard while
checking the exact method, path, request body, and non-secret response fields,
or through a separately reviewed client that opens the mode-0600 personal-token
file itself and redacts foreign provider errors. Never put the bearer token in
argv, an environment variable, shell history, or terminal output. Stop if
neither safe path is available.

```sh
bun x convex env list --names-only --deployment benevolent-akita-439
```

Clear every slug-bound authority before renaming. Team Settings must still
show one active Admin member, no Authorized Applications for that member, no
other active member, and no custom roles. The authenticated Management API
readback
`GET /v1/projects/2680173/list_preview_deploy_keys?includeManaged=true` must
return an empty `items` array. These checks rule out custom-role selectors,
project OAuth tokens, and both manual and integration-managed preview keys that
would otherwise follow or break on an `oprte` slug change. Search operator
bookmarks and external automation for the old `cclrte:oprte` selector and
replace each confirmed consumer with `cclrte:hra`; HRA source itself selects
the deployment by name and requires no source change.

Retire the stale staging deployment separately after the same acceptance gate.
Its current immutable identity is deployment `4828041`, name `cool-bear-228`,
project `2680173`, cloud type `prod`, non-default, reference `staging`. Its two
known broad keys, `vercel-oprte-staging-2026-08-10-c` and
`vercel-staging-2026-08-08`, have never been used. Before deletion, read back
that no provider, domain, integration, automation, data, file, or required
backup still depends on it. Preserve an explicit backup or defer retirement if
that evidence is not closed. Otherwise revoke both keys and delete only
deployment `4828041`. Require `GET /v1/deployments/cool-bear-228` to return not
found and `GET /v1/projects/2680173/list_deployments` to contain neither ID
`4828041` nor name `cool-bear-228`. Do not treat deletion of the shared
Production deployment as part of this cleanup.

After staging retirement and the slug-bound-authority checks, send only
`PATCH /v1/projects/2680173` with the Management API body
`{"name":"HRA","slug":"hra"}`.
Read back the exact HRA name/slug, unchanged team and Production project/deploy
identities, unchanged Production URL, unchanged environment-name set, and
unchanged deploy-key metadata. The direct deployment dashboard URL and both
public Convex endpoints must remain reachable. This is an in-place label and
slug update, not a deployment transfer, data copy, environment rewrite, or key
rotation.

During the bounded rollback window, send only
`PATCH /v1/projects/2680173` with `{"name":"oprte","slug":"oprte"}` if the
rename readback or a known external selector fails. Repeat the same
immutable-ID, Production URL, names-only environment, and key-metadata
comparison. After HRA acceptance and rollback disposition are final, revoke
the predecessor Production keys, detach
`oprte.com` and `hraness.kitchen` while retaining the domains in the account,
then delete the predecessor Vercel project. Deleting that project earlier would
destroy its READY deployment and environment rollback anchor.

The deployed source owns a read-only internal audit. Its no-candidate form
returns only selector state, exact-key counts, and a closed status:

```sh
bun x convex run suiteIdentityAudit:audit '{}' \
  --deployment benevolent-akita-439
```

After both HRA and Accounts have been configured from the same mode-0600
candidate file, verify HRA with the source-owned wrapper:

```sh
bun run verify:receipt-provider -- \
  --secret-file /private/absolute/canonical/path/to/receipt-secret
```

The wrapper validates the file descriptor and permissions, sends only a fresh
random challenge to the internal audit, and compares its domain-separated HMAC
response locally with a timing-safe check. It accepts only
`keyCount=1`, `hraProductionV1Count=1`, `otherKeyCount=0`, `selectorV1=true`,
`status=ready`, and `candidateSecretMatch=true`. Its output contains only those
counts, status, and match bit. Run the Accounts counterpart against the same
candidate before deleting it; shape-only readback does not prove shared-secret
equality.
The file argument must use its exact native `realpath` spelling. In particular,
macOS temporary paths often print `/var/...` while the canonical path is
`/private/var/...`; pass the canonical result rather than the alias.

Never install the HRA-only keyring until the candidate deployment in step 3
has completed and its HRA parser is live. The predecessor backend may reject
the new shape, which would leave neither checked source nor a safe rollback
path in authority.

The shared deployment may retain
`OPRTE_HOSTED_MUTATION_FINGERPRINT_KEY_CURRENT`, its exact `_VERSION`, and
`OPRTE_SESSION_SYNC_ENABLED` as compatibility inputs. HRA adopts the matching
HRA names only when absent or byte-for-byte equal, so do not rotate or delete
those values during this authority cutover. A production suite-link E2E also
requires separately provisioned WorkOS provider authority. If it is absent,
verify the parser, deployment readbacks, and unavailable response, and record
the WorkOS-backed E2E as an external gate rather than creating credentials or
claiming it passed.

## Public product pages

`/download` links to the exact Apple Silicon GitHub prerelease named in
`app/site.ts`. It publishes the checksum path and discloses that the current
app is ad-hoc signed, not Developer ID signed or notarized. The web workspace
never holds signing credentials or release authority.

`/alternatives` and its static child routes compare HRA with adjacent tools.
Every positive competitor claim must cite a current first-party source, every
page carries a review date, and “not documented” must never be presented as
proof of absence. These routes remain public when WorkOS is configured; exact
near-miss and control-plane routes remain protected.

## Hraness suite account

The authenticated rail includes an optional Hraness account status beside the human controls. This is additive subscription identity only. WorkOS remains authoritative for the human, organization, membership, and organization role; Convex remains authoritative for workspace roles and task state. A suite alias never identifies an agent, credential, session, desktop runner, or repository, and suite features do not gate an HRA capability.

`/api/suite-auth/[...all]` is HRA's OAuth 2.1/OIDC relying-party route for the canonical `account.hraness.com` service. Access and refresh tokens remain encrypted in server-only `HttpOnly` cookies. The browser receives only the bounded suite session view and short-lived signed receipts; it does not persist provider tokens or send them to Convex.

Linking requires both a live Hraness session and a currently authorized WorkOS human with an active projected organization membership. Convex mints a four-minute HMAC proof bound to that WorkOS subject, persists the challenge, verifies the returned link receipt, and atomically rejects both local-human-to-second-account and account-to-second-human conflicts. Entitlement receipts are verified with the same environment-scoped keyring before a monotonic revision/observation projection is stored. The public query labels that projection `fresh`, `stale`, or `unverified` and returns no receipt signature or secret.

Product-local identity linking fails closed until the HRA runtimes are configured:

- The web host needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://hra-weld.vercel.app`, a distinct `SUITE_OIDC_COOKIE_SECRET`, and `SUITE_IDENTITY_RECEIPT_KEY_VERSION`. Missing or mismatched values make the suite route return `503 SUITE_OIDC_UNAVAILABLE`.
- Deploy exact Suite Accounts v0.3.0 overlap support before changing either receipt keyring. Generate a fresh independent secret as the canonical unpadded base64url encoding of at least 32 random bytes. The HRA Convex `SUITE_IDENTITY_LINK_KEYS` keyring contains only the `hra:production:v1` entry. Accounts appends that same HRA entry alongside its unrelated existing entry. Never copy the unrelated Accounts key into HRA. Both environments use `SUITE_IDENTITY_RECEIPT_KEY_VERSION=v1`.
- This cutover admits exactly one HRA production/v1 key. Extra HRA versions, development entries, non-HRA entries, a selector other than `v1`, and malformed configuration make proof and receipt actions return `unavailable`. Rotate only through a later reviewed contract that restores bounded multi-key verification. No predecessor OPRTE/Kitchen receipt key is expected to exist, and the predecessor receipt authority being unavailable or invalid is not a rollout health gate.
- The ordinary hosted WorkOS and HRA Convex configuration described above must also be live, because suite linking reuses the existing WorkOS human and active organization-membership authorization rather than creating another product principal.

WorkOS-to-Hraness identity linking remains unavailable until the web session
and HRA receipt keyring are configured. Missing suite configuration does not
block WorkOS sign-in or any HRA task capability.

## Deterministic browser lab

HRA web has a credential-free Direct composition that renders the real task workspace through the same app-owned props and action port used by the live Convex adapter. It does not mount WorkOS, construct a Convex client, import generated APIs, or claim to simulate provider sessions and database transaction semantics.

The workbench also mounts the shared System-first appearance provider with a concrete light pre-bootstrap fallback. Its final toolbar action is the same one-trigger Light/Dark/System menu used by production, so the deterministic surface exercises persisted preference, keyboard operation, and theme-relative task presentation without importing any production identity or transport adapter.

Start the scenario workbench or run its bounded Chromium evidence pass from the repository root:

```sh
bun run direct:hra:web
bun run verify:hra:web:direct
```

From this directory, `bun run test:direct` checks the strict world parser, inferred definition, session-owned exact action scripts and deterministic backend, canonical probe/coverage wire parsing, verifier policy, and production-exclusion boundary. `bun run build:direct` compiles only the isolated Vite lab. `bun run build` compiles the Next.js application and rejects any resolved or emitted Hugeicons module. Run `bun run check:direct-boundary` as a separate production-boundary check.

The browser verifier exercises representative read, mutation, failure, and retry paths at wide, stacked, and compact viewports. It waits for identical canonical probes, rejects console, page, request, pending-work, and script-drain failures, then writes ignored screenshots and an atomic manifest below `artifacts/direct/hra-web`.

These scenarios are deterministic UI evidence. WorkOS authentication and organization switching, real Convex subscriptions and transactions, HTTP/CLI interoperability, and hosted deployment remain direct or mixed-evidence gates and are not relabeled as Direct coverage.
